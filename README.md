### FAQ
***what is this?*** - most speedtests like speedtest.net connect to random isps and providers, the aim is to measure your speeds with servers most people connect to. (google, discord, microsoft, etc)

***what servers do you have right now?*** - google drive, dropbox, microsoft onedrive and discord.

***is this perfectly accurate?*** - not perfect, but close enough

### READ
*feel free to modify the script! adding servers is really easy but just fork it and don't reupload without any credit!*

### LAST TESTED ON PYTHON 3.11
use terminal/cmd, opening it directly as a file will be dumb because it will close immediately after it prints the result, you shouldn't do that at all anyways.
